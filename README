PSEUDO-PRINT --- print lisp as pseudo-code

The PSEUDO-PRINT library uses the Common Lisp's pretty printing
facilities to print pseudo code instead of lisp code.  It relies
heavily on the use of format strings.  See [1] for a great reference
on Common Lisp's pretty printer, and for more information on this
library including examples see [2].

Note: This library is early days, and many common macros and functions
      are not yet supported.  Patches welcome.
